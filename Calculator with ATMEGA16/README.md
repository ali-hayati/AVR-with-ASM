The calculator project is implemented in assembly language and operates using an ATMEGA16 microcontroller. It features a 2x16 character LCD display and a 4x4 keypad.
In this project, the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are implemented for two-digit numbers and simulated using Proteus simulation software.
The assembly code is written using Atmel Studio, which is available for download and use.
The program's source file can be found at the following path:
