The calculator project is implemented in assembly language and operates using an ATMEGA16 microcontroller. It features a 2x16 character LCD display and a 4x4 keypad.
In this project, the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are implemented for two-digit numbers and simulated using Proteus simulation software.
The assembly code is written using Atmel Studio, which is available for download and use.
